Firstly, you need a cable to connect the two ports to each other. The port on the left side is for transmission and the port on the right side is for reception. At the top there is a Text box where you need to write the packet you want to transmit. Above it there is another text box where you need to specify how many cycles to send this packet. The cycle begins when sending and ends after receiving. To start the cycles, both ports must be open and the two text boxes I have already described must be filled in.
